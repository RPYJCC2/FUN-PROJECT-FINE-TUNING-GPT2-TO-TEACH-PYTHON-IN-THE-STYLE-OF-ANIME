00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,905
Lu la lu la

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:11,144
A piano sends its melody to the fields
of dreams all over the world

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,647
Believing the broken clock

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,946
Whose side is time on?

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:25,081
Why is my heart waiting so eagerly
for someone kind?

6
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,661
Tell me my wonderful future

7
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,965
Moonlight, moonlight sleepin'

8
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,867
Lu la lu la

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:38,972
A girl awakens to the apple of memories
and bestows a kiss

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,542
In the book spread open in sorrow

11
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,875
Their bell rings

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,243
Because I want to hug the one dear to me

13
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,974
Don't cry anymore, goodbye sadness

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:59,926
The letters on the mysterious door say,
"Fancy hearing cake"

15
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,294
Wonderland!

16
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,029
Welcome, for you...

17
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,364
Fairyland!

18
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,032
It's the magic of love

19
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,400
Love's all way!

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,605
Everyday, the fluffy temptation of wheat

21
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:13,940
Cake for you!

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,708
Please eat, tonight...

23
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,910
Tea for you!

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,745
Is a tea party of constellations

25
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,815
A chorus of angels at the window

26
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,251
Did you just fancy hearing that?

27
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,812
The voices saying,
"I love you, I love you"

28
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,588
Good morning!

29
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,094
Morning!

30
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,706
Azumanga Daioh

31
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,674
Azumanga Daioh
It's Azumanga!

32
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,265
It's Azumanga!

33
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,205
Child High School Student

34
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,618
Whoa! Look at the time!

35
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,038
What the? What happened here?

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,371
Oh, what is the deal with this?!

37
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,309
Shoot! I'm late! I'm late!

38
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,884
Miss Yukari, what's the matter?

39
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,990
Oh, I can't believe this!
This is so irritating!

40
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,489
If I'm late on the first day
of the new school year,

41
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,995
that vice principal's gonna give me
a good long earful again.

42
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,165
Miss Yukari.

43
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,157
"Miss Tanizaki, how many times
have you been late now?"

44
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,132
"Keep this up and you'll never set
a good example for the students."

45
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,895
"They're at a very impressionable
age, after all."

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,076
Impressionable, my ass. It's so ridiculous.
Unbelievable!

47
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:57,343
Miss Yukari!
Impressionable, my ass. It's so ridiculous.
Unbelievable!

48
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:57,944
Miss Yukari!

49
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,845
Oh, man, it's pissing me off
just remembering it!

50
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,748
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn,
damn, damn, damn! Argh!

51
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,281
Miss Yukari...

52
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:11,658
Miss Yukari, you're going to break it!

53
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,493
What's your problem?! Trying to mess
with me, huh?!
Miss Yukari, you're going to break it!

54
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:13,826
Take that and that! And that and that!

55
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,851
Come on, Miss Yukari! Miss Yukari!

56
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,553
Miss Yukari!

57
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,261
Oh, the chain just came off.

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,066
This'll be easy to fix.

59
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:24,771
I'm so lucky.

60
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,103
If I'm with a teacher, they won't be
so hard on me for being late.

61
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,142
Hey, Miss Yukari, today's...

62
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,947
My bike!

63
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,754
I made it.

64
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,351
Damn that friggin' chain!
I'll get you for this!

65
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,757
Good morning!

66
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,732
Hi, everyone!

67
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:56,936
Yukari Tanizaki

68
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:01,134
Yukari Tanizaki
Okay, I'm Tanizaki, the homeroom teacher
for Class 3.

69
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,638
If there's anything you don't
understand, just ask me!

70
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,477
Excuse me, Miss Tanizaki...

71
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,337
Oh, no, no. Not that.

72
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,313
My three sizes are a se-c-ret.

73
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:16,945
But it's not because I don't have a good
figure and I'm embarrassed to say.

74
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,259
I don't mean to brag, but my
measurements are pretty amazing.

75
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,829
Oh, please, look at what
you made me say!

76
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,660
You bold boy!

77
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,426
No, well, your class is next door.

78
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,062
This is Class 4.

Kaorin

83
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,255
Okay, starting today, I'm the homeroom
teacher for Class 3.

84
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,723
My name's Tanizaki. Nice to meet you.

85
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,260
Ow, that hurts!

86
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,996
Oh, right.

87
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,366
Moving right along, let me introduce
a transfer student.

88
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,494
This is Chiyo Mihama.

89
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,305
Chiyo Mihama
Chiyo-chan

90
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,406
Chiyo Mihama

I'm Chiyo Mihama.

91
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:06,735
I'm Chiyo Mihama.

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,733
Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,137
Chiyo-chan is ten years old,

94
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,745
but she's been admitted to high school
because she's very gifted.

95
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,349
Please don't pick on her, just because
she's smart for a brat.

96
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,356
Chiyo-chan, hang in there!

97
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,192
We'll be rooting for you!

98
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:28,688
Thank you.

99
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,869
Let's cook together, let's cook together.

100
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,304
Now, now, let's see what we've made.

101
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,602
There, it's done!

102
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,813
Let's cook together, let's cook together.

103
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,416
Now, now, let's see what we've made.

104
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,749
There, it's done!

105
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,285
But this isn't cooking at all, is it?

106
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,590
She's a Prodigy

107
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,357
Chihiro
Chihiro

108
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,510
Yes, that's right.

109
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,085
Oh, Chiyo-chan, already
getting help from her?

110
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,219
Technically an English teacher
Oh, Chiyo-chan, already

111
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:26,486
Technically an English teacher

112
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,322
Technically an English teacher
Oh, good! Fine! Fantastic!

113
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:29,617
Oh, good! Fine! Fantastic!

114
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,991
If there's anything you don't understand,

115
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,515
don't hesitate to ask any of the other
students, okay?

116
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,758
I won't!

117
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,655
The truth is...

118
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,222
The truth is...

119
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,390
The truth is...

120
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,699
The truth is, I was the one getting help!

121
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,978
Am I stupid?

122
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,276
But we are classmates, so...

123
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,879
Okay, time for lunch.

124
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,615
Don't cry, don't cry.

125
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,888
Chiyo-chan, let's have lunch together!

126
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,251
Oh, okay.

127
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,861
We had school lunches
in elementary school,

128
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,056
so it's sort of fun to be
bringing lunch to school.

129
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,620
Really?

130
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,965
But it's tough to get up early
to make lunch.

131
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,136
What?!

132
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,736
She makes her own lunch?!

133
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,938
Before, I only got to bring lunch for
sports fests and nature walks.

134
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,414
And it looks pretty good too!

135
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,312
What is she, Miss Perfect Superwoman?

136
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,359
There, the Double Bridge.

137
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,097
Wow, you're good at everything.

138
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,893
I bet there's nothing you're not good at.

139
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,364
That's not true, there are some things.

140
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,106
Let's see...

141
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,877
Oh! I'm bad at tongue twisters.

142
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,542
Tongue twisters?

143
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,974
I'll give it a try.

144
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:07,981
Bus gas bast gus, bus gas blast gut,
gas blast gut gut...

145
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,417
Oh, darn it, she's just so cute!

146
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,220
If you didn't do your homework,
raise your hand!

147
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,804
That's it! You're not getting
away with it today!

148
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,736
All right, come up to the front!

149
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,478
You better do your homework from now on!

150
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,654
Yes, Sir.

151
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,223
Uh, well...

152
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,867
I was a little careless and...

153
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,062
I was planning on doing it, but...

154
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,902
I forgot.

155
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,486
Let's cook together, let's cook together.

156
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,316
Now, now, let's see what we've made.

157
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,786
There, it's done!

158
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,330
Let's cook together, let's cook together.

159
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,990
Now, now, let's see what we've made.

160
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,865
There, it's done!

161
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,166
This time, it was a success!

162
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,476
Now, let's all eat togeth...

163
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,377
Oh, you can't eat it yet!

164
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,021
Scary Maybe?

165
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,027
Excuse me.

166
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,628
Day Duty
Excuse me.

167
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,598
Day Duty
Did you turn in the questionnaire
on your career preferences?

168
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:58,965
Day Duty

169
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,500
Day Duty
Oh, sorry. Wait a minute, okay?

170
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:01,934
Day Duty
Okay.

171
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:02,457
Okay.

172
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm collecting the questionnaire
on your career preferences.

173
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,432
Here. Thanks.

174
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,105
That leaves...

175
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,203
Excuse me...

176
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,872
Excuse me, I'm collecting the career
preference sheets.

177
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,954
Okay, thank you.

178
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,786
She seems kind of scary.

184
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,564
Maybe she's a nice person.

185
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,811
Hey, hey, Miss Sakaki's so cool,
don't you think?

186
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,046
Yup, yup, she's the best!

187
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,446
She's way better than most
of the boys around here!

188
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,385
Yeah, I know! And I love how
she's a woman of few words!

189
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,616
What's the matter?

190
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,722
Nothing.

191
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,262
Just now, just now, I thought...

192
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,201
I thought I saw something really cute...

193
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,072
Bye-bye!

194
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,331
Miss Sakaki.

195
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:19,237
Miss Sakaki, do you belong to any clubs?

196
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,379
No, I don't.

197
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,143
So, I belong to the Astronomy Club and...

198
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,487
Astronomy Club?

199
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,011
Yes.

200
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:34,088
We do research on stars, talk about space,

201
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,453
and go out to look at the stars.

202
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,194
If you'd like, would you also...

203
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,034
Would I also?

204
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,402
Oh, no!

205
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,168
If you're not interested in that
sort of thing, it's okay, really!

206
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,897
Please just forget that I said anything!

207
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,465
Goodbye!

208
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,742
I wish she'd invited me.

209
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:36,977
A cat...

210
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,876
Miss Sakaki.

211
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,147
Miss Sakaki.

212
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,352
What happened to your hand?

213
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,152
Oh, this.

214
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,823
I wonder if he was in a bad mood?

215
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,399
I wonder if she got into a fight?

216
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,007
I'm pretty sure it was around here.

217
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,609
It's the cat from this morning!

218
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,311
Oh, he's coming! He's coming towards me!

219
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,215
He looks like he's in
a good mood this time.

220
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,536
I'm Tomo Takino!

221
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,438
Being energetic is the one thing
I'm better at than anybody else!

222
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,736
The wildcat high school girl!

223
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,510
Good morning, everyone!

224
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,112
Yukari-chan's already here!

225
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,117
Which means, I'm late?! Oh, shoot!

226
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,518
As punishment for being late,
I'll go stand out in the hallway!

227
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,355
I don't really care, you know.

228
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,451
Wildcat Tomo-chan!

229
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,488
I've been wanting to give this a try.

230
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:32,104
In this day and age, you rarely get
sent out to stand in the hallway.

231
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:35,767
All right, I'm gonna set a record or
something and surprise everyone!

232
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,545
5 Minutes Later

233
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,113
5 Minutes Later
Piece of cake, piece of cake.

234
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:41,580
5 Minutes Later

235
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,816
10 Minutes Later

236
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,117
10 Minutes Later
Not yet, not yet.

237
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,086
15 Minutes Later

238
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:47,987
15 Minutes Later
Here it comes, here it comes!

239
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,155
15 Minutes Later
Now, it's starting to feel
like a punishment!

240
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:50,322
15 Minutes Later

241
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,892
20 Minutes Later

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
20 Minutes Later
Not gonna lose!

243
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,121
Not gonna lose!

244
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,027
Hey, you there, you're doing pretty good!

245
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,562
Yo, what's your name?

246
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,892
Oh, you got me!

247
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,698
Damn it, just you remember this!

248
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,209
There's water everywhere!

249
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,278
Oh, no! Floor cloth! Towel! Anything!

250
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,279
Someone bring me something!

251
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:13,946
Oh, Miss Yukari, help me!

252
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,811
Sheesh, she's so noisy.
Oh, Miss Yukari, help me!

253
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,909
Ta-da!

254
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,443
Challenging Chiyo-chan in schoolwork!

255
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,487
I don't think that'll be possible.

256
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:27,223
Okay, Chiyo-chan, do you
know the answer?

257
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,396
Well, no, I don't.

258
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,454
Me!

259
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,499
Okay, Miss Takino.

260
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,966
I don't know, either!

261
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,003
Chiyo-chan, that means we're tied. Yay.

262
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,099
All right! Lunch! Today, it's bread!
I'll have bread!

263
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,503
Well, I'm gonna go buy bread!

264
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,214
Get me one too!

265
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,340
Me too!

266
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:51,471
Gotcha!

267
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,850
She sure is dependable when it comes
to things like this.

268
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,213
I know what you mean.

269
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,818
Goal!

270
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,155
You bought them already?

271
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,795
That was really fast.

272
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,593
So, what was my time?

273
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,123
I wasn't timing you.

274
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,335
Ta-da!

275
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,400
Challenging Series, Part 2!

276
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,798
Challenging Miss Sakaki in P.E.!

277
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,605
What's this about a series?

278
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,174
You and me, 100 meter race, Miss Sakaki!

279
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,647
Go for it, Miss Sakaki!

280
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,447
Please do your best!

281
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,743
All right, here we go.

282
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,387
Why?

283
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,418
Challenging Miss Sakaki?

284
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,023
But Miss Sakaki is really athletic,
isn't she?

285
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,062
Could Tomo-chan have some secret plan
or trick for winning?

286
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,621
No, I don't think she has anything.

287
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,403
Get set! Ready!

288
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:44,937
Hold it!
Get set! Ready!

289
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,665
Hold it!

290
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,974
Miss Sakaki, your breasts are eight
centimeters bigger than mine,

291
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,566
so step back eight centimeters!

292
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,245
What's with that?! That's playing dirty!

293
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,016
Eight centimeters...

294
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,780
Okay, here we go for real now!

295
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,079
Ready! Set!

296
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,355
Go!

297
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,785
Oh, Tomo-chan's taken the lead!

298
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,358
It's just a matter of time.

299
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,928
Damn it, I'm not gonna lose!

300
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,742
Goal! Miss Sakaki wins!

301
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,878
Miss Sakaki!

302
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,520
Miss Sakaki, you were amazing!

303
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:36,821
Here you go.

304
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:37,952
Thanks.

305
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,058
Are you all right?

306
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,453
A crushing defeat.

307
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,732
Runner up!

308
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,834
I didn't lose! I'm the runner up!

309
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,970
Run-ner up!

310
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,063
Okay. I get it, so let's go back.

311
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,707
Runner up!

312
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,608
Enough!

313
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,477
Then, number two!

314
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,341
Moron!

315
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:00,913
The Osakan Gal

316
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,616
The Osakan Gal
Well, we're actually getting a new
transfer student today.

317
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,117
The Osakan Gal
What?! Again?!

318
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,085
The Osakan Gal
How old is this one?!
What?! Again?!

319
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,210
How old is this one?!
What?! Again?!

320
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,650
The newest addition to our forces
is an Osakan.

321
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,115
I had a bit of a hard time getting her, though.

322
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,060
An Osakan?!

323
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,527
Tsutenkaku, Takoyaki
Culinary Capital, Osaka

324
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,862
Tsutenkaku, Takoyaki
Culinary Capital, Osaka
When you think of Osaka...

325
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,162
Tsutenkaku, Takoyaki
Culinary Capital, Osaka

326
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,397
Tsutenkaku, Takoyaki
Culinary Capital, Osaka
You profittin' there?

327
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,898
Tsutenkaku, Takoyaki
Culinary Capital, Osaka
It's comin' along.

328
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,159
Tsutenkaku, Takoyaki
Culinary Capital, Osaka

329
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,634
It's a rival!

330
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,127
She's probably equipped with some
incredible comebacks!

331
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,096
Yomi, take a dig at me and say,
"Why the heck?"

332
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,509
What?

333
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,476
Come on!

334
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:32,710
Why the heck?

335
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,451
You think I should make a huge show
of it like that when I respond?

336
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:43,955
Why the heck?

337
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:44,919
Ayumu Kasuga

338
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:48,026
Well then, now that we've cleaned up
all the desks,

339
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,755
I'll introduce you to her.

340
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,589
Miss Kasuga.

341
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,936
Okay, introduce yourself.

342
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,276
Yes, Ma'am.

343
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:05,944
Ayumu Kasuga

344
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,081
Ayumu Kasuga
My name is Ayumu Kasuga
and I am from Osaka.

345
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:09,548
Ayumu Kasuga

346
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,483
Ayumu Kasuga
Nice to meet you.

347
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:11,650
Ayumu Kasuga
No, no.

348
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,810
No, no.

349
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,478
You don't have to be so considerate
and speak in standard Japanese.

350
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,753
You can just say,
"Darn pleased ta meetcha!"

351
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,261
But, even in Osaka, I...

352
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,228
Go on.

353
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,392
Darn pleased ta meetcha...

354
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,425
Is it true that people in Osaka

355
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,729
cross streets even when the light is red?

356
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,701
Well, I dunno. I don't.

357
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,443
I don't like bustlin' places that much.

358
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,945
You don't seem too much like an Osakan.

359
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,849
I was imagining a more
rowdy kind of person.

360
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:50,422
It's not like all Osakans are rowdy.

361
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,912
Imposter!

362
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,154
Imposter? I'm an imposter?

363
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,592
You say I'm an imposter, but...

364
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,420
Okay, then show me your lunch!

365
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,633
It'll be crystal clear,
once we take a look at it!

366
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,358
An Osakan's lunch should
have takoyaki in it.

367
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,338
What? But...

368
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,333
Just because I'm from Osaka,
it doesn't mean...

369
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,075
What?!

370
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,507
Why the heck?

371
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,317
All right!

372
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,286
"I was too busy to complete the work."

373
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,054
People often told me back in Osaka that
I was spaced out.

374
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,424
This "too 'adjective' to 'something"
has a negative implication
People often told me back in Osaka that
I was spaced out.

375
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,226
that you were unable to do a task
because you were too "something".
People often told me back in Osaka that
I was spaced out.

376
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:27,492
that you were unable to do a task

377
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,459
that you were unable to do a task
because you were too "something".
But...

378
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:29,461
I'm thinkin' I should take this transfer

379
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,195
Get it together
I'm thinkin' I should take this transfer

380
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,720
Get it together
as an opportunity to get it together.

381
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,734
Get it together. Get it together.
Get it together.

382
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,535
Miss Kasuga.
Get it together. Get it together.
Get it together.

383
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:36,835
Miss Kasuga.

384
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,337
Get it together. Get it together.

385
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:38,971
Miss Kasuga!
Get it together. Get it together.

386
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,596
Miss Kasuga!

387
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,265
Miss Kasuga, were you listening?

388
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,007
Oh, no.

389
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,043
Sheesh, get it together.

390
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,946
Okay, Mr. Ohyama.

391
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:49,982
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,349
Get it together. Get it together.
Get it together.

393
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,984
Oh, it's time already.

394
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,146
Teacher's done for the day.

395
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,125
Well, adios!

396
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:04,694
It's finally over.

397
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,162
I'll get it together startin' tomorrow.

398
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,331
Get it together. Get it together.

399
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,662
Osaka! Osaka!

400
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,804
Say, Osaka, do okonomiyaki
meals really exist?

401
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,565
Huh? Osaka?

402
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,835
Yeah, yeah, Kansai people
sure are strange,

403
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,946
eating rice with their okonomiyaki.

404
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,210
Do you do that at home too, Osaka?

405
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,654
Osaka? You mean, me?

406
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,588
Yeah, it's your nickname.

407
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,656
Osaka, because you're from Osaka.

408
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,825
What?

409
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,157
Just like that?

410
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:40,132
Did you all hear me?! Miss Kasuga's
going to be Osaka from now on!

411
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,099
What?!

412
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,358
Oh, sure.

413
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,556
Okay!

414
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,096
Yes, I understand.

415
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,563
Roger that!

416
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,834
There you have it, it's set.
You're Osaka!

417
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,008
Well, I look forward to having you
as a classmate!

418
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,748
Before I knew it, my nickname
ended up bein' Osaka.

419
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,841
It's like, wah.

420
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,183
Ayumu Kasuga

421
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:05,322
Ayumu Kasuga
Osaka

422
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,256
With wings upon your soul

423
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,063
Convey the whispers of your heart

424
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,697
Now, riding the wind

425
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,968
Your soul is beyond the stars

426
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,775
Your wishes will come true, without fail

427
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:41,087
Come see me, that key is for the future

428
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,596
The voice calling softly by the window

429
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:49,400
Speaks of love to come and...

430
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,568
Even if the love is still far off

431
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,141
I have faith in tomorrow

432
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,310
I have faith in you

433
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,145
Raspberry heaven

434
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:05,606
I promised you that you're not alone,
remember, heaven?

435
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,448
Raspberry heaven

436
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,248
Such sweet tears

437
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:15,227
Smile again in paradise

438
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,956
Raspberry heaven

439
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:22,523
I've come for you,
the heaven of gentle dreams

440
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:27,229
Raspberry heaven, I'm coming back to you

441
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:32,077
On the day the flowers in paradise bloom

442
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,204
You and I...

443
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,377
Let's meet, just the two of us

444
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:43,286
Next Azumanga Daioh

445
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,558
This is "Azumanga Daioh (Great King
Azumanga)," right?

446
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,759
What's this all of a sudden?

447
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,095
So, where's Prince Azumanga?

448
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,222
The prince is the king's kid, right?

449
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,694
Then, would it be the show that was
airing before we came along?

450
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,427
Wouldn't it be the one after?

451
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,738
It's weird to be calling it Great King
to begin with anyway.

452
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,229
I know! The culprit is right here with us.

453
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,508
What do you mean, "culprit"?

454
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,136
This preview is Prince Azumanga!
